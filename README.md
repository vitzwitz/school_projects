Python Projects :
  - Pokemon (Individual)
    - Program that simulates the game of Pokemon.  Main sets up game: Plays Pokemon game by prompting user for info, using decks as heaps, Pokemon as objects, and recursive functions for battling the Pokemon
    
  - Road Trip (Individual)
    - Program takes in data involving a road trip and determines the number of stops needed to take and which stations to stop at using classes
    
  - Expression Trees (Individual)
    - Creates, computes, and prints expressions using binary expression trees
    
  - Farmer Eddie (Individual)
