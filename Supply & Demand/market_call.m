% Product examples used:
% Diamonds
% Beanie Babies
% Epi-pens
% Knitted dolls
% Cars
% Candy canes/Candy Corn

% Assume all dimensionless

% Questions to ask for each comparison:
% (1) Where is the behavior crazy?
% (2) Where is there low activity?
% (3) What needs to change in order to fix the poor economical scenario?
% (4) How do the functions help the system?
% (5) How strongly do the factors affect the product's success?
% (6) What values allow high-low supply & demand dynamic
% (7) Do these values cause any chaos, useless behavior, or lack of
%     behavior when using non-oscillatory functions?

% Compare & Examine Thresholds:

% Case 1: High supply threshold, low demand threshold: 

% Case 2: Low supply threshold, high demand threshold: 

% Case 3: Low supply threshold, low demand threshold

% Case 4: High supply threshold, high demand threshold

% Compare & Examine Oscillatory Functions:

% Case 1: When f_D oscillates more than f_s:

% Case 2: When f_D oscillates the same as f_s:

% Case 3: When f_D oscillates less than f_s:

% Case 4: When f_D & f_s are non-oscillatory functions:
% (1) linear
% (2) exponential/logarithmic
% (3) polynomial

% Compare high price & demand factors:

% Case 1: high price, low demand:

% Case 2: low price, high demand:

% Case 3: low price, low demand:
% **Talk about the importance of tricking of rarity & exploitation, ex
% etsy, homemade art

% Case 4: high price, high demand:
% **Talk about the importance of tricking from advertisement &
% exploitation, ex diamonds

% ** Tricking into becoming high-low dynamic

% Understanding Collectibility Factors & Saturation Factors

% (1) Collectibility:
% Has one:
% Doesn't:

% (2) Saturation:
% Has one:
% Doesn't:

% (3) Both
% Has one:
% Doesn't:
% Might be pointless

% Tie together high price & demand factors, thresholds, collectibility &
% saturation factors, rate of change in price

% Comparison 1: 
% (1) High price & high demand, high collectability
% (2) Low price & low demand, high collectability

% Comparison 2: 
% (1) High supply threshold, high saturation
% (2) Low demand threshold, high collectability

% Comparison 3: 
% (1) Low demand threshold, low saturation, high collectability
% (2) High demand threshold, high collectability, high saturation

% Comparison 4:
% (1) High rate of change in price, low supply threshold, high saturation
% (2) Low rate of change in price, collectability, low demand

% Comparison 5:
% (1) High supply & demand thresholds, High price & high demand,
% (2) low supply & demand thresholds, low price & low demand, high rate of
% change in price
