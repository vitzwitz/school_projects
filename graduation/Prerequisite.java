/**
 * This program takes as input data from a file corresponding
 * to a directed graph.  For the particular application, we assume
 * the data corresponds to courses and prerequisites.  But in
 * general, the concept applies to any directed graph.
 *
 * We assume one feature of the graph, and 
 * using graph methods, we determine two other features of the graph:
 * <p>
 * ASSUMED: The nodes of the graph (courses) can be ordered
 * in such as way that every class can be taken after its prerequisites
 * have been met.  That is, there are no CYCLES in the directed graph.
 * Determining whether this is true for an arbitrary input graph is a problem
 * for a different day, a different class.
 * <p>
 * 1) Given such an ordering exists, we compute for each course how many other
 * courses must be completed before that particular course can be taken.
 * This corresponds not just to direct prerequisites, but to prerequisites
 * of the prerequisites, etc.
 * <p>
 * 2) Given such an ordering exists, what is the longest chain of
 * prerequisites in the graph?
 * This corresponds to how long it will take to graduate - given that you can't
 * take a course until its prerequisites are met (can't take simultaneously), 
 * it will take at least this many semesters to graduate.
